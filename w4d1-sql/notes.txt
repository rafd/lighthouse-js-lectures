Why?

  Why databases?
    organized way to store and manage data
    usually to disk (but in memory also exists)

    ...alternatives?
      roll your own, store shit to files (shitty)

  Why relational databases?
    relational model good-enough for a lot of data
    very popular

    ...alternatives?
      object stores
      key-value stores
      document stores
      graph stores
      ...why choose?
         cost / open-source
         db model match your data
         performance match your data
         scaling strategy
         ACID, CAP

  Why SQL?
    defacto standard for relational databases

    ...alternatives?
      not really

  Why...
    Sqlite?
      most popular embedded SQL
      mature, well tested
      not for production (no multi-client; one write at a time)

    MySQL? Postgres?
      mysql was most popular open-source sql db
      development stagnated after being acquired by Oracle
      ...postgres is the new favorite

    ...alternatives?
      many other non-free alternatives

Week Overview
  SQL -> knex (js library to create SQL queries) -> ORMs (treating tables as objects)



Schema
  Creating Tables
    Types:
      Integer, Decimal, Text, Date, DateTime
    Constraints:
      Unique, Not Null, Primary Key
    Foreign Keys
      relate data between tables
    Indexes
      indexing a column makes querying by it faster
    Primary Keys
      unique identifier for a record, usually used in relationships

    CREATE TABLE

  Updating
    ALTER TABLE

basics (CRUD):
  SELECT
  INSERT
  UPDATE
  DELETE

advanced queries:
  joins
    SELECT ... JOIN ...

    can have left/right inner/outer

  groups
    GROUP BY

  aggregates
    SUM
    AVG
    COUNT
    MIN
    MAX
    for strings:
      GROUP_CONCAT (sqlite)
      STRING_AGG(col, ',') (postgres)


    HAVING

    ** if you are using an aggregate, you probably need a GROUP BY **

    1-*  (one to many)
    *-*  (many to many)
